## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lucio Sianca <P> A passionate developer from Argentina


<h1 align="center">Squid Game</h1>

  
This project was made with the intention of making my first project in programming and the process was very fun. I recommend trying to do it to people who are just starting as in my case because you are going to learn many new things and you are going to enjoy it a lot.

I did it with javascript, html and css.

With this code you can do whatever you want but if you give me a little credit I would appreciate it.

Send me an email if you do any modifications, or if it was useful, or whatever you want to say to me.

This project was based on AngleÂ´s video:

Hope this can help you!
